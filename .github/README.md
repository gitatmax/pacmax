# Pacmax

Pacmax was originally a place for folks to explore & share their favorite extensions of the lovely [Alfred](https://alfredapp.com) application. It's expanded & changed shape but has always kept to its mission of raising awareness of cool add-ons for all sorts of applications. Why's this repository empty, now? A lot is coming, so check back before long for more information here on all of the ways you can interact with Pacmax!

## REST API

This is undergoing an overhaul. Please stay tuned :)
