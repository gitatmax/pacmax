# Pacmax

Pacmax was originally a way for folks to share their favorite extensiosn for the lovely application [Alfred](https://alfredapp.com). It's expanded & changed forms a few times but, most recently, has taken to offer itself up as more of a set of data. In this new form, Pacmax is able to support more great apps alongside Alfred like DEVONthink, Keyboard Maestro, Raycast & more. All with less overhead (woohoo)!

## What's New

- New
  - Form for adding to Pacmax
  - Added support for several more apps like DEVONthink, Keyboard Maestro, & Raycast

## What's to Come

- An improved REST API
- Favelets to Add & Search Pacmax
